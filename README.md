# SBA-2
SBA 2 - Accessible Web Page
An accessibility challenged I faced was the contrast in text and the background pictures for some of my elements. I addressed them my tweaking with the opacity.
I ensured my design was responsive and accessible to all users by manually entering ARIA roles to enhance accessibility. 
W3Schools.com was the most helpful resource for me in this project.
